                I am a 24 year old self-taught aspiring software engineer. I worked exclusively in Java from 2017 to early 2022.
                In 2022, I decided to attend university and enrolled into a course for Python programming. With roughly 5 years of
                experience in Java, I excelled in my Python course. Java gave me a strong foundation for designing code and thinking
                of ways to accomplish tasks. 
                <br>
                <br>
                After attending university for a very brief time, I decided that the best way for me to make my dreams a reality is to
                take charge and pilot my path to success. Rather than be part of the many that pursue their bachelor's in computer science,
                I've chosen to learn and apply the knowledge in projects I felt passionate about, rather than projects that would get me good grades.
                <br>
                <br>
                Growing up, I always had a curious eye for technology. I always wanted to spend excessive amounts of time on computers and
                learn everything I could about them. Living in Washington State has made this even more prevalent, as surrounding companies
                such as Boeing and Microsoft made the industry just seem so unique and interesting to me. With the accessiblity of the internet,
                being able to learn and apply the knowledge has never been easier. In this day and age, I'd like to try and leave my mark on the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                As 2022 is drawing to a close, I would like to begin taking extreme leaps into the field. As I continue to grow and become more
                experienced individually, I would also like to gain experience working collaboratively. While I'm no stranger to individual and
                team-oriented success, being able to bounce ideas off of others and learn from more experienced people in the field is the best
                way for me to gauge where I stand in the crowd. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I would like to accomplish this goal of mine to show others that no barriers can stop them from pursuing their dreams. After I finished
                attending community college, I was unable to immediately attend university due to its financial cost. Instead, I went to work in
                electronics and manufacturing. In doing so, I was able to learn from those with more experience than myself, people who would finish up
                their studies or work after serving many years in the military. With such a diverse background and such a wide range of knowledge, I slowly
                began to realize that me not immediately attending university wasn't gonna stop me from rising to greater heights. What was stopping me was
                myself. Still, the idea that I had to finish my bachelor's was drilled in to me at a young age, and so after saving up I returned to school.
                Not long after, I found myself wanting more from my experiences. School is one way to achieve a person's goals and live their dreams, and
                that opportunity might have been taken away from me. The rosy-eyed glasses that university was everything cleared up as I was out of school
                for longer and longer. I'd like to not have someone else's dreams blockaded the way mine had been, and so as I walk this journey of self-learning
                I do so in the hopes that one day I could allocate enough money to fund others' education.
